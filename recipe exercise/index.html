  <h3>Instructions</h3>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Chow mein sauce:</strong> In a small bowl, whisk the sauce ingredients together and set aside.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook chicken:</strong> Heat a large pan or wok on high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil. Season chicken with salt and pepper and add to hot pan. Sauté until cooked through, then remove to a plate.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook Veggies:</strong> Add another tablespoon of oil. Once hot add cabbage, carrots, celery, and the whites of the chopped green onion. Stir fry over high heat for 1-2 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds, then remove everything to a plate.</li>
    <li><strong>Noodles:</strong> Add last tablespoon of oil to the pan and add the noodles. Cook for 1 minute. Add the sauce and cook, tossing to coat. Return veggies and chicken to the pan, along with fresh bean sprouts.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve</strong> immediately, garnished with green onion.</li>
 </ol>

 <h3>Notes</h3>
 <ul type="disk">
    <li><strong>Cabbage and Carrots:</strong> If you’re in a hurry, you could use bagged coleslaw mix that has shredded cabbage and carrots.</li>
    <li><strong>Chow Mein noodles:</strong> I often use Yakisoba noodles because I can get them at my local grocery stores (discard the seasoning packet), but for the most authentic noodles, use fresh chow mein noodles from a local Asian foods market, or Dry chow mein noodles that are labeled as “hong kong” or “pan fried” chow mein noodles, which have already been par-boiled and can be added right to the pan. You could also use dry wonton noodles or lo mein noodles, cook according to package instructions, drain well, and remove excess moisture from them before adding to stir-fry.</li>
    <li><strong>Add more veggies</strong> like Bok choy, bell peppers, mushrooms, snap peas, broccoli, and water chestnuts would all work well.</li>
    <li><strong>Protein:</strong> Substitute beef, tofu, or shrimp.</li>
    <li><strong>Vegitarian:</strong> Leave out the chicken, or swap with tofu or your favorite vegetarian protein source.</li>
    <li><strong>Vegan:</strong> Leave out the chicken, or swap with your favorite vegan protein source. Substitute hoisin sauce instead of the oyster sauce.</li>
 </ul>
